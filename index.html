        <p>
          Not sure who told you this was Elliot's website, they were probably lying. I've never even heard of an Elliot in my life. 
          I mean, besides the one in E.T. And Open Season. And that poet guy. How did you even get this link? Who told you about this? <b>How did you get here?</b>
        </p>
      </section>

        You're making this <strong>really</strong> annoying for me, do you know how much work it takes to type all this <i>garbage</i> out?? <em>I'm just trying to enjoy my lunch</em>. Get outta here.

        <br>

        Actually, why don't you just go <a href="https://elliotdkim.github.io/">here</a> and look at this other Elliot's website? It looks much nicer than this one anyway.

        <summary>Don't click me</summary>
        What's your problem? I told you not to click me.
      </details>

      <div>
        If you're still reading this, I'm getting real tired of talking to you now. Here, look at this picture of an extremely good looking E-Type Jag that I'm sure this Elliot would love to own and get on with your life

        <br>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ON-CX282_etype_M_20190311124711.jpg">
          <figcaption>The Jaguar E-Type. A beautiful feat of engineering and design. Something you know very little about.</figcaption>
        </figure>

      </div>

      <br><br><br><br><br><br>

      I swear, why are you still reading this? I'm losing my mind
      
      <br><br><br>

      Why am I so angry? Well, here are some reasons:
      <ol>  
        <li>This isn't Elliot's Website</li>
        <li>You're an idiot</li>
        <li>You've interrupted the sanctity of my lunchtime</li>
        <li>I don't even know who Elliot is</li>
      </ol>

      <br>

      Here's the list again, without numbers, because you're probably horrible at math:
      <ul>  
        <li>This isn't Elliot's Website</li>
        <li>You're an idiot</li>
        <li>You've interrupted the sanctity of my lunchtime</li>
        <li>I don't even know who Elliot is</li>
      </ul>

      <br><br>

      In fact, I'm so mad at you wasting my precious time that I'll even make it into a nice table for you, in case you're one of those weirdos that's into tables (go shower btw)
      <table border="5" cellspacing="0">
        <caption>Here you go you nerd</caption>
        <colgroup>
          <col span="1" class="theonlyclass">
        </colgroup>
        <tr>
          <th>Why I'm pissed off out of my mind</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>This isn't Elliot's Website</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>You're an idiot</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>You've interrupted the sanctity of my lunchtime</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>I don't even know who Elliot is</td>
        </tr>

      </table>
      <br><br><br>

      If you're <b>STILL</b> here, I kind of respect your commitment. You're probably stuck in Vim because you want to figure out how to exit (it's <code>:qa!</code> btw) I'm sure you're expecting some kind of interesting or important content to appear. Well, you're wrong. There's literally nothing here besides this seal. So save your time and go somewhere else.

    Ok fine. I don't even know what to type anymore. I'm literally out of ideas. So here's a picture of a cup. Why? I have no clue:

    Let's make a deal. You go watch this video of some cute dogs, and you leave me alone. How about that?
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    Ok what about this random audio file I found on the internet? Will this do it for you? <br>
    <audio

            Your browser does not support the

    <br><br>

    Or this random video conveniently found on the Mozilla html reference website?

    <br><br>

    <video controls width="250">

    Fine. Since I have no clue who Elliot is and you seem to be extremely interested in this website, given that you're still here for some reason, here are some random facts about me, because why not.

    <br><br>

    My favorite shape: <br>

    <svg viewBox="0 0 10 10" x="200" width="100">
      <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="4" />
    </svg>

    <br><br>

    My favorite 300x300 empty html canvas element:

    <br><br>
    <canvas width="300" height="300">
      Literally nothing. Just an empty 300x300 box. I just happen to like it a lot
    </canvas>

    <br><br>
